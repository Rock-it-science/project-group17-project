## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to analyze the data in this dataset to produce useful and insightful conclusions regarding each of our research questions. This dataset in particular is interesting to us all because it is easily accessible and contains a substantial amount of data with interesting attributes. All of us are interested in exploring questions that relate to genre and popularity, and the different factors that influence either or both of those variables. Our dataset offers a lot of attributes to choose from, and breaks down the data in several ways, including by track, by artist, by album, by genre, and a summary of auditory features from Librosa and Echonest. To answer our research questions, we might look at data at attributes such as track/artist genre, the artists' geographical location, number of releases per artist, number of releases per year, and the auditory features of the music itself. There will be no shortage of opportunities to explore and answer different questions with this dataset, so it should be no problem to populate a dashboard with analytics from it.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset, the Free Music Archive (FMA), exists in GitHub and was created by Michaël Defferrard, Kirell Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst, and Xavier Bresson and published in 2017. The dataset contains information on over 100’000 songs, including metadata such as track names, artist names, genres, artist locations, language, etc. The dataset also includes auditory analysis features from Echonest and Librosa for every track. The motivating idea behind the dataset is to address the fact that "the community's growing interest in feature and end-to-end learning is ... restrained by the limited availability of large audio datasets." The dataset was created for the purpose of research and learning at a large-scale with easily accessible data that has permissive licensing. The main section of the dataset it the audio data, but for the purposes of this project we will just be using the metadata described above. The data was originally collected from 22 different music databases with licensing from all included data.
